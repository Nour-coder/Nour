      What is Rocket League?

    <p class="center about-text">
      Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars",
      Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's
      goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online,
      including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes,
      including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.
